Crystal Detection with YOLOv8 

#Overview
This repository contains the code for the crystal detection project, which uses a trained YOLOv8 model to detect crystals in real-time using a webcam or video input. It measures the size of the detected crystals, converts pixels to microns, and triggers an action (e.g., stopping a beam) if a crystal exceeds a defined size threshold.
